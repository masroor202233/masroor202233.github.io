     <P>
         <b>Activities:</b> I try to get up during the Fajr prayers every day, but it didn't every day. Even then, whenever I get up, I offer Fajr prayers.
         <br/> I got busy with other accessories of the day. If there is a class, I do it. If there is not, I do it if there are  homeworks and assignments. Now that the 
         <br/>pendemic has spread, I have reduced the number of leaving my home. Also watch TV or YouTube in my spare time.
